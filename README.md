## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Nexted layout technique

### What I learned

Learnt it's best to just style the inner contents, and let them determine the width and height of thier containers.

Tried giving the container a fixed width which didn't allow it's content scale properly.

### Continued development

Still struggle with giving elements good enough names. I spend alot of time thinking about good names to give my elements.
